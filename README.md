# MATH540 Final Project

#Authors: Olzhas Shortanbaiuly, Aigerim Kalizhanova

#OlzhasShortanbaiuly_AigerimKalizhanova_MATH540_ProjectReport: Report file "Study on Error Bounds for Support Vector Machines", containing the anaysis of the performance of Hard-margin SVM both on synthetic and real data, done by finding and comparing training and test errors of the classifier output to the theoretical error bound. The validity of theoretical error bound was proven based on this model. The document provides appropriate theory, methodology, discussion of the results and the conclusion with some possible suggestions to improve the project.

#OlzhasShortanbaiuly_AigerimKalizhanova_MATH540_ProjectCode: .ipynb file written in Google Colaboratory, containing the Python code for Hard-SVM and error analysis.
